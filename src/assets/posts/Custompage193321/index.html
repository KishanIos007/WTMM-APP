<p>- &nbsp;Based on your research data model your gig title, use intriguing words into the title to ensure it catches your target customers the attention and is relevant to him/her.</p>

<p>For e.g. If you are offering a logo designing gig. You should consider using titles such as</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll design 3 <strong>MAGNIFICENT</strong> logos in 24 hours<br />
I&rsquo;ll design a <strong>PROFESSIONAL</strong> logos with free revisions<br />
I&rsquo;ll design 2 <strong>STUNNING</strong> logos <strong>BONUS</strong> Free editable file</p>

<p>- All the above titles are beautifully crafted because they include two important things.</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, they all have intriguing words such as MAGNIFICIENT, PROFESSIONAL, STUNNING and BONUS. These words definitely help to catch the attention of the right people.</p>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, they all are appealing to the most important aspects that any person who wants to design a logo is looking at.</p>

<p><strong>For e.g. </strong>The first title &ldquo;3 MAGNIFICENT logos in 24 hours&rdquo; will appeal to the people who are in urgent need of a logo.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The second title</strong> &ldquo;PROFESSIONAL logos with free revisions&rdquo; will appeal to the kind of people who want the option of incorporating their changes into logo design.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The third title</strong> &ldquo;2 STUNNING logos BONUS Free editable file&rdquo; will appeal to the people who have some knowledge of logo designing and want to customize the logo on their own.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Create your gig&rsquo;s image</strong> - While doing initial homework you must have observed that some gigs have better images than other which makes them really stand out.</p>

<p>Shortlist such images and take inspiration from them while modelling your image.</p>

<p>6. <strong>Write gig&rsquo;s description</strong> - Your gig&rsquo;s description plays an important role in convincing your potential customers to place an order with you.</p>

<p>So you must ensure that your gig&#39;s description is precise, clear and appealing to your potential customers.</p>

<p>Study other top related gig&rsquo;s descriptions to get some inspiration and model your description on them.</p>

<p>Remember, don&rsquo;t ever copy other gig&rsquo;s description it will get you banned.</p>

<p>Just use theirs to get ideas for creating your unique description.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you&rsquo;re listing your gig into the right category to maintain its relevancy.</p>

<p>7. <strong>Use right tags</strong> - Tags play most important role in ranking your gig higher.</p>

<p>Most people don&rsquo;t realise its importance and ignore them, hence it provides you with the best opportunity to overtake them if you optimize your gig properly using accurate tags.</p>
