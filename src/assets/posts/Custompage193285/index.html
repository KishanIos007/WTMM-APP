<p>Being a blogger is one of the easiest ways to earn money from home.</p>

<p>Unlike any other job, if you are blogging from home. You don&rsquo;t need to work 9-5.</p>

<p>You can work at any time of the day with ease.</p>

<p>But beware blogging takes time before it starts making money for you.</p>

<p>So I suggest you jump into this field slowly.</p>

<p>If you have a day job, don&rsquo;t quit it. Start part-time with your blog.</p>

<p>Once it is on the stage where it is earning you more than your comfortable limits then it&rsquo;s the best time to turn into full-time blogging mode.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a complete beginner, a day or two would be sufficient to be ready with the basic setup.</p>

<h3>Tips - &nbsp;</h3>

<p>1. Start a blog about something in which you are really good at.</p>

<p>For e.g. If you love travelling and you have travelled a lot of places then start a travel blog. &nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Always try to limit your blog to a particular domain. Don&rsquo;t put content about multiple domains in one blog.</p>

<p>For e.g. Writing about recipe tips on a fashion blog.</p>

<p>Keep your blog specific to one domain only.</p>

<p>3. Using your experience and expertise, try to create a very unique and phenomenal content.</p>

<p>4. Try to give a lot of value to your readers. Write about something that will make a difference in your reader&#39;s&rsquo; life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Listen to the readers of your blog. Try to solve the problems they are facing. Always reply to their comments. Make them feel better.</p>

<p>6. Be committed to your blog. A blog is like a relationship. Give it some love and it will flourish. Ignore it and it will die a death.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no point in being half-hearted in your blogging efforts - if you don&rsquo;t care about it, why should anyone else?</p>

<p>7. Think about content, style, tone of voice, audience, etc.</p>

<p>Look at the people who already do what you&rsquo;re planning to do. &nbsp;Ask yourself the following questions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>How will I stand out from the crowd?</li>
	<li>What can I say that hasn&rsquo;t already been said?</li>
	<li>What&rsquo;s my unique selling point?</li>
	<li>Why do I want to do this?</li>
</ul>

<p>8. Be professional in the way you handle and grow your blog.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t criticize other brands, bloggers or people. Remember what goes around comes around.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t want something you&rsquo;ve said to come back and bite you one day.</p>
