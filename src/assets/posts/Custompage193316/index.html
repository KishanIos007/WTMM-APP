<h3>What is a Membership Site?</h3>

<p>A membership site is a private website, with exclusive content available only to the signed up members.</p>

<p>It usually provides members with the ability to interact with each other. They pay a monthly fee for being a member of the website.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Suitable For -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>People who like to interact with, guide and lead a community.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Skills Required -</h3>

<p>1. In-depth knowledge of any particular domain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Ability to research new things and constantly generate new and helpful content.</p>

<h3>Time Required For Creating A Membership Site -</h3>

<p>Depends on the domain expertise of the creator.</p>

<p>Do Google search for Matthew Woodward&#39;s tutorial on how to create a membership site for free.</p>

<h3>Tips -</h3>

<p>1. In the beginning keep the fee for joining the membership site ridiculously low.</p>

<p>Aim to create a minimum viable product instead of creating a perfect product. You can always improve your site in later stages.</p>

<p>2. If you&rsquo;ve never been a part of any membership site till now, consider joining a few related to your domain. Study those sites.</p>

<p>3. Find what&rsquo;s working well for you and other members of that site? What&rsquo;s makes it worth the monthly fee and how could you replicate this?</p>

<p>4. Interact and engage with members. Your membership site shouldn&rsquo;t be the one that only drip feeds the content, with little or no input from the owner.</p>

<p>You must provide insider access<strong> </strong>for your members who want to communicate with you.</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re busy, you must spend at least half an hour a day to get involved with your membership site.</p>

<p>You can do this by many ways, such as you can interact with the members answer their questions or even lead an interaction inside the forum.</p>

<p>5. Run group events and challenges to increase members&rsquo; engagement with your site.</p>

<p>Organize regular events, challenges, or similar.</p>

<p>Make it easy for members to participate. Offer prizes, display leaderboards or similar such things creates a great incentive for members to participate and get involved.</p>

<p>6. Periodically review what&rsquo;s working and what isn&rsquo;t. Try to adapt the site based on the member&#39;s&rsquo; needs.</p>

<p>For e.g. If you offer most of your content in text format but your members are engaging more with the video content then shift from text-based to video content.</p>

<p>7. Try to introduce new initiatives and see how your audience is responding to it. Such as live Q&amp;A calls or similar.</p>

<p>But be careful, don&rsquo;t overwhelm members with several different initiatives at once. Introduce one thing at a time.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>How To Monetize -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Monetization is very simple. More members sign up to your website more income you generate from the monthly fees that members pay.</p>
