<h3>What is eBay.com?</h3>

<p>eBay is the most popular website to buy and sell goods on the internet.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a place where individuals and businesses can buy or sell new or second-hand items, from books and clothes to cars to almost anything.</p>

<h3>Here&#39;s how eBay works:</h3>

<ol>
	<li>A seller lists an item on eBay, almost anything from antiques to mobile phones, books to sporting goods.</li>
	<li>The seller chooses whether to sell the item at a fixed price or accept only bids (auction-type listing).</li>
	<li>In an auction-type listing, the bidding opens at a price the seller specifies and remains on eBay for a certain number of days.</li>
	<li>Buyers then place bids on the item. When the listing ends, the buyer with the highest bid wins.</li>
	<li>In a fixed price listing, the first buyer willing to pay the seller&#39;s price gets the item.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Suitable For -</h3>

<p>People who are self-motivated and know how to spread the word &ndash; to friends, family members, acquaintances and strangers using online or offline mediums.</p>

<h3>Skills Required -</h3>

<p>Some experience of selling goods online or offline is welcome, along with a business savvy mind.</p>

<h3>Time Required To Start Selling On eBay -</h3>

<p>To start selling you first need an eBay account and a PayPal account.</p>

<p>After that, you need to enlist your product for which you&rsquo;ll need upload some product pictures and write an appealing description.</p>

<p>Even if you are a beginner you can do all the above tasks within a day or two.</p>

<h3>Tips -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>1. If you are completely new to eBay and your account does not have any feedback, then getting some feedback before starting to sell anything is a good practice.</p>

<p>People are very wary of buying anything online nowadays, so if your account has 0 feedback then no one&rsquo;s is going to buy anything from you.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s recommended that you should get at least 10-15 feedbacks before selling anything.</p>

<p>The simplest way to get feedbacks is to buy 10-15 $0.99 items with free shipping.</p>

<p>Many sellers leave positive feedback to you straight way when you&rsquo;ll make payment.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Start small</strong> - Most of the eBay resellers buy a bulk wholesale stock of any particular product then sell it on eBay at a retail price.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have money to buy a wholesale stock then find out unwanted items present in your house which are in good condition and make a list of them.</p>

<p>3. <strong>Research</strong> - Now as you have a list of few ready to sell items you must ensure that there is a market for them.</p>

<p>Take 10 minutes to Google your item and uncover its true market value on eBay and another bunch of e-commerce sites.</p>

<p>This will help you to sell right items more competitively because you&rsquo;ll have the knowledge of your item&rsquo;s market and its pricing strategies.</p>

<p>Also, dig out relevant targeted keywords which will help people to find your items via Google search engine.</p>

<p>4. <strong>Craft the title</strong> - Title is the single most important factor for grabbing the attention of your potential buyer.</p>

<p>Make sure your title is appealing, complete and you&rsquo;ve included targeted keywords.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a tech wizard for this. Just ask yourself, what would a potential buyer for this item type into the search box?</p>

<p>5. <strong>Write item&rsquo;s description</strong> - Fill out all the fields in your listing, and make sure your textual description is providing all the information that your potential buyer might look for.</p>

<p>Most of the lazy sellers ignore this and fail badly at selling anything on eBay.</p>

<p>6. <strong>Upload item&rsquo;s pictures</strong> - Upload only high-quality pictures. Ensure that item&rsquo;s pictures are new, clear (not blurry) and cover the product from all angles.</p>

<p>Also, don&rsquo;t restrict yourselves to 2-3 pictures upload at least 6 pictures.</p>

<p>7. <strong>Timing</strong> - Most of the expert sellers use 10 day listing starting on Thursday, you should use it too, it will give you two full weekends of eyeballs. You&rsquo;ll usually receive the highest traffic on weekends.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>How To Monetize -</h3>

<p>Monetization is very simple. More people place orders with you more money you make.</p>

<p>Your item quality and delivery influence your user feedback which directly affects your order placement.</p>

<p>So make sure you are delivering items with good quality.</p>

<p>eBay handles all your transactions securely, so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about any payment processing issues.</p>

<p>Once you are in a profit making stage, buy your most selling products in bulk on a wholesale price and the sell them on retail price to increase your profits.</p>

<p>Rinse and repeat.</p>
